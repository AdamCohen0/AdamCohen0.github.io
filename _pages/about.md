Welcome! I am second-year PhD student at UMN interested broadly in mathematical physics, topology, and geometry. I'm originally from Brooklyn, NY and have very strong opinions about pizza.
I like to cook, sing, and pet my cat when I'm not doing math, preferably all three simultaneously.

I've worn a few mathematical hats over the years. Some topics I've been interested in or studied: spectral geometry, index theory, Dirac operators, spin geometry, symplectic geometry (Floer/Morse theory, Hamiltonian dynamics, geometric quantization, classical mechanics), contact geometry (Reeb dynamics, h-principle, overtwisted contact structures), complex geometry (Kahler manifolds, GAGA, Riemann surfaces), operator theory, K-theory, rational homotopy theory, low-dimensional topology (3-manifolds, surgery theory, bordisms, TQFTs), quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, gauge theory (Yang-Mills, Chern-Simons, Seiberg-Witten), etc.
